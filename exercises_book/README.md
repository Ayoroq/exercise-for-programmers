# My JavaScript Journey: Solutions to "Exercises for Programmers"

This repository documents my ongoing journey through Brian P. Hogan's book "Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills." I'm implementing the exercises in JavaScript, creating solutions for both command-line and web browser environments. 

## Why I Created This Project

When I started working through Hogan's book, I decided to use JavaScript as my implementation language to strengthen my skills in both frontend and backend development. What began as simple exercise solutions evolved into a comprehensive collection that showcases my growth as a developer.

## About the Book

"Exercises for Programmers" by Brian P. Hogan presents 57 programming challenges that progressively increase in complexity. The book starts with basic input/output operations and builds toward more complex applications involving data processing, file manipulation, and API integration.

I found the structured approach of the book extremely helpful, as it allowed me to build my skills incrementally while applying JavaScript best practices to each solution.

```

## My Command-Line Solutions

I started with command-line implementations to focus on core JavaScript concepts before adding the complexity of browser APIs. These exercises helped me build a solid foundation in:

- Working with user input and formatted output
- Implementing control flow with conditions and loops
- Creating reusable functions and modules
- Manipulating data structures like arrays and objects
- Processing strings with regular expressions
- Reading and writing files
- Handling errors gracefully
- Writing asynchronous code with promises and async/await

### My Favorite CLI Implementations

- **hello.js** (Exercise 1): My first exercise - a simple greeting program that taught me basic I/O
- **guess_num.js** (Exercise 32): A number guessing game where I implemented multiple difficulty levels and random number generation
- **anagram.js** (Exercise 24): I learned string manipulation techniques while creating an algorithm to check if two strings are anagrams
- **bmi.js** (Exercise 19): I implemented health recommendations based on calculated BMI values
- **password_strength.js** (Exercise 25): I used regular expressions to evaluate password strength against multiple criteria
- **word_frequency_finder.mjs** (Exercise 46): This challenged me to process text files and analyze word frequencies
- **filter_records.mjs** (Exercise 42): I learned to transform and filter CSV data based on various criteria
- **website_generator.js** (Exercise 43): I generated HTML websites from templates and user input

## My Browser-Based Solutions

After gaining confidence with the CLI exercises, I moved to browser-based implementations. This allowed me to apply what I learned while adding:

- DOM manipulation techniques
- Event handling for user interactions
- Form validation and processing
- Fetch API for network requests
- Responsive design principles
- CSS styling for visual feedback
- Performance optimizations

### My Favorite GUI Implementations

- **guess_num.html** (Exercise 32): I enhanced my CLI version with animations and a more engaging UI
- **bmi.html** (Exercise 19): I added visual feedback and a more intuitive interface
- **password_strength.html** (Exercise 25): I implemented real-time strength indicators as the user types
- **multiplication_table.html** (Exercise 12): I created an interactive table generator with customizable ranges
- **website_gen.html** (Exercise 43): I built a browser-based website generator with live preview
- **contest.html** (Exercise 44): I implemented comprehensive form validation and submission handling

## My Featured Project: Photo Search (Exercise 49)

The Photo Search application in the `gui/photo-search` directory is my implementation of Exercise 49 from the book. This exercise challenged me to create an application that retrieves and displays photos from a web service.

I decided to extend the basic requirements into a more comprehensive full-stack JavaScript application that:

1. Provides a clean, responsive search interface
2. Fetches high-quality images from the Unsplash API
3. Retrieves contextual content from Reddit through a custom proxy server
4. Displays results in a dynamic, responsive gallery

### What I Learned Building Photo Search

- How to design a modern user interface with flexbox
- Techniques for working with third-party APIs
- Creating a Node.js proxy server to overcome CORS limitations
- Implementing error handling for both client and server
- Writing clean asynchronous code with async/await
- Combining data from multiple sources into a cohesive experience

### Running My Photo Search Application

If you want to try my Photo Search application:

1. Navigate to the photo-search directory:
   ```
   cd gui/photo-search
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install express node-fetch cors
   ```

3. Add your Unsplash API key in `config.js`:
   ```javascript
   const accessKEY = 'YOUR_UNSPLASH_API_KEY';
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

5. Open `index.html` in your browser

## Data Files I Used

Throughout the exercises, I created various data files for testing and processing:

- CSV files for employee records, contest entries, and numerical data
- Text files for word processing and analysis
- JSON files for configuration and structured data

Working with these files taught me how to:
- Parse different file formats
- Transform data between formats
- Filter and aggregate information
- Handle file system operations in JavaScript

## My Development Environment

For anyone interested in my setup:

- **Node.js**: v16 (though v14+ should work fine)
- **Code Editor**: VS Code with ESLint and JavaScript plugins
- **Browser**: Chrome with DevTools for debugging
- **Terminal**: iTerm2 for running Node.js applications

## My Learning Journey

### Phase 1: JavaScript Fundamentals
I started with basic exercises like `hello.js` and `adding_numbers.js` to get comfortable with JavaScript syntax and user input. These simple programs built my confidence and prepared me for more complex challenges.

### Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts
As I progressed, I tackled exercises like `anagram.js` and `password_strength.js` that required more sophisticated algorithms and data manipulation. This phase significantly improved my problem-solving skills.

### Phase 3: Browser Applications
Moving to browser-based implementations was exciting as I could create more interactive and visually appealing solutions. I enjoyed seeing my programs come to life with `guess_num.html` and other GUI applications.

### Phase 4: Advanced Integration
I'm currently in this phase, working on the more complex exercises that involve API integration and full-stack development. The Photo Search project (Exercise 49) has been particularly rewarding as it allowed me to apply many concepts I've learned so far.

## Challenges I Faced

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Understanding promises and async/await took time
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers
- **API Integration**: Managing rate limits and handling authentication
- **Error Handling**: Creating robust applications that gracefully handle edge cases
- **Responsive Design**: Making interfaces that work well on different screen sizes

## What I'd Do Differently

If I were to start over, I would:
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Implement more comprehensive testing
- Create a more consistent API structure across applications
- Focus more on accessibility features
